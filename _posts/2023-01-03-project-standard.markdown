description: The Standard Insurance Company had to suddenly abandon its paper-based operations in 2020, and even two years later most of the processes had issues.  My job as Kaizen Systems Analyst was to understand our new workflows and find improvements to help dig our front-line analysts out from the pandemic backlog.
